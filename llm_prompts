I have an input file in which records are organised in concept and properties like the following:
 
{
"concept": "advertisement",
"properties": [
"Aims to persuade",
"Uses various media",
"Can be informative",
"Measures response rates",
"Often features testimonials",
"May use emotional appeals",
"Influences consumer choices",
"Can be regulated",
"Is a marketing tool",
"Is a form of communication"
]}

however, some of the JSON blocks are not complete. There is a missing curly bracket "}" that ends the JSON block FOr example the following record:

{
"concept": "advertising",
"properties": [
"Promotes products or services",
"Uses various media channels",
"Targeted to specific audiences",
"Measures effectiveness",
"Can be persuasive",
"Often uses visuals and text",
"Has various forms (print, digital, etc.)",
"Influences consumer behavior",
"Has ethical considerations",
"Is a multi-billion industry"
]

Sometimes the curly bracket "}" occurs in the next line after the square bracket "]" like the following record: 

{
"concept": "advice",
"properties": [
"Helpful guidance",
"Opinion-based",
"Personal or professional",
"Given by an expert",
"Can be explicit or implicit",
"Intended to benefit",
"May be sought or given",
"Can be formal or informal",
"Can be verbal or written",
"May be followed or ignored"
]
}

I will provide you with a sample file and your job is to extract all "concept" and "properties" pairs keeping in mind the above two types of incomplete records in the file. 

Please find attached the sample file.
