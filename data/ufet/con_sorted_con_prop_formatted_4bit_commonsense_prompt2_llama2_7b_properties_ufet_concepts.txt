sacrifice fly	definition: a player on a baseball team who is intentionally inserted into a game as a substitute for a player who is already on base.	1.0
sacrifice fly	explanation: the sacrifice fly is a strategic move in baseball where a player on base is intentionally hit by a pitch or fly ball to allow the player on base to score.	1.0
sacrifice fly	example: a player on first base hits a fly ball to the outfield, and the runner on first base scores while the batter is out.	1.0
sacrifice fly	history: the sacrifice fly has been a part of baseball strategy since the early 20th century.	1.0
sacrifice fly	key players: the sacrifice fly is often executed by a designated hitter or a player who is not known for their batting skills.	1.0
sacrifice fly	tactics: the sacrifice fly is typically executed in a situation where the team is down by a run or has a runner in scoring position.	1.0
sacrifice fly	success rate: the success rate of a sacrifice fly is relatively high, as the runner is already on base and the batter is often trying to get a hit.	1.0
sacrifice fly	risks: the sacrifice fly can be risky if the batter is not able to get a hit or if the runner is unable to score.	1.0
sacrifice fly	variations: there are variations of the sacrifice fly, such as the 'sacrifice bunt' or 'sacrifice steal'.	1.0
